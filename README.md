## Linear Regression to Predict MPG  
### Variables Providing Non-random Variance to MPG Values  
Length (p-value 2.60e-12)
Ground Clearance (p-value 5.21e-08)

### Slope of Multiple Linear Regression  
The slope of the multiple linear regression would be non-zero as the p-value is significantly smaller than .05.  The p-value is 5.35e-11, or 0.00000000000535.

### Prediction
This regression model is able to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.  The overall p-value is significantly smaller than .05, indicating a definite slope to the linear model, and the r-squared value is .71, indicating a strong correlation.  In other words, 71% of the variability in mpg values can be attributed to the six variables analyzed.
